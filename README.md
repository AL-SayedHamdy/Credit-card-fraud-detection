Credit Card Fraud Detection: Credit card companies should detect fraudulent credit card purchases so that consumers are not charged for products they have not purchased. However it is an exceedingly difficult task as there could be only 1000 cases of fraud in over a million transactions, representing a mere 0.1 percent of the dataset, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets. When trained with imbalanced datasets, the ML algorithms are very likely to create inaccurate classifiers as they appear to show a preference towards the majority class, treating the minority class as a noise in the dataset. Also because of the "accuracy" class imbalance.
